# DNNConnect-Xamarin
This is the demo project from the DNNConnect 2015 session "Mobile Development with Xamarin".

It is a very simple one-page Xamarin.Forms app which shows the page list from a DNN site in a grouped ListView. 

The session slides are at http://www.slideshare.net/MarkAllan3/dnn-connect-mobile-development-with-xamarin.
